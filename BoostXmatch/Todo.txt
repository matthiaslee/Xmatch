
 TODO:
------
 - Optimize output to files -> optional ascii output
 - obj segment size
 - check defaults
 	- maxout --> defaults to jobA*jobB  
 - add conditional for timing
 
 - large catalog * 2 >> (max of jA and jB * 10<param?>)
 - look into zone size for allocation
 - perhaps presorting
 - figure out segment size based on memory
 
 - push code over again
 - recompile on nodes!

Notes:
------
To build Boost for x64, do this:
.\bootstrap.bat
.\b2 --toolset=msvc-10.0 address-model=64


Questions:
----
- Should I be throwing a verbose warning if more results are returned then allocated?
- make Blacklisting and option? hidden feature?


Version 2.0 Feature list
----
- Dynamically adjust the job size and therefore memory use to the card we are running on
