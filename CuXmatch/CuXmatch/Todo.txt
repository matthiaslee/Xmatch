I tried to collect my thoughts on the project and compile a short list of things to do to make the CuXmatch
code better:

 o Seek to end-of-file and get sizes in bytes before reading file

 o Check if datasets fit in host and/or device memory:
   - If not, process them in chunks!
   - Perhaps merge sort files that are bigger then RAM?

 o Open output file and append the results from the zone-zone xmatching

 o Final step of dumping results is slow because of memory lookups:
   - Write and test xmatch kernel that saves the IDs instead of the
        indices of the found matches
    (The dump of a buffer would be much faster than fetching IDs...)

 o RA wraparound when everything else works

Have any questions about these bullets?
